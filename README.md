# Gas-leakage-detection-system
Detects the concentration of gas leaked into the atmosphere and displays it on a screen  and sounds an alarm
This project was built using the arduino uno break out board.
COMPONENTS INVOLVED
 -MQ5 gas sensor
 -LCD
 -Buzzer
 -LED bulbs
 -Resistors
 -jumpper wires.
 
HOW IT WORKS 
the mq5  sendor detects the prescence of methane gas in the air and the LED bulb comes on. the buzzer also comes on. There 5 LED bulbs once there is no LPG gas detected in the air the gree LED comes on and it remains so until LPG is detected in the air. the other 4 LED bulbs come on the depending on the concentration of lpg in the air. The buzzer also produces different sounds at different at various concentration levels.
